This is a showcase project built on the first assignment in Dave Churchill's COMP4300 class, taught at Memorial University in Newfoundland, Canada, the lectures for which he publishes online.
The purpose is simply to practice with the SFML and Dear ImGui libraries as well as the ImGui-SFML binding.

The Dear ImGui and ImGui-SFML source files are included, but a user will need to download and install the compiled SFML library to run this project.
I must stress that the project as assigned had to be only one file. I wouldn't normally code like this! But it was fun!
